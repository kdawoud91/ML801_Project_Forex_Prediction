# Forex Price Prediction: A Case Study utilizing Supervised Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning Approaches
## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project that uses supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques to predict Forex (foreign exchange) prices. The project aims to provide a practical demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to financial markets, specifically Forex trading.

Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Forex trading carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.

## Project Description
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models for Forex price movements. The project combines two main approaches:

Supervised Learning: In this phase, historical Forex price data is used to train supervised machine learning models. These models are trained to predict future price movements based on historical features such as price patterns, technical indicators, and economic news.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is applied to build an automated trading agent that makes decisions based on the predictions generated. The agent learns to take actions (e.g., buy, sell, hold) in a simulated trading environment and is optimized for profit maximization.
